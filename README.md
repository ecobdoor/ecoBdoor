Hello,

ðŸ”­Retired engineer since 2 years, I play with esp32 boards to develop a ESP32 rover & a  ESP32-CAM sending alarm SMS and uploading images to a ftp server.

ðŸ¤”I don't know  how to contact particularly ESP32_FTPClient contributor of which I rewrite a little bit the library to send jpeg files from app_httpd or eloquent motion example.

âš¡My development is quite advanced but I have no experience with github management to publish.
